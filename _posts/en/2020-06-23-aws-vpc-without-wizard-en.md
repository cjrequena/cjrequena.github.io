# Creating a VPC without using the wizard

In this post we are going to create a VPC with a private and public subnet without using the wizard to get into VPC in detail and to know how it works 
internally. 

You also can create your VPC using the wizard following the AWS tutorial 
[Creating a VPC with Public and Private Subnets for Your Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/create-public-private-vpc.html)

1.  Open the AWS console and go to **Services â†’ Networking & Content Delivery** section and make click on VPC.

2. On the left menu, in the **VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD** section, click on **Your VPCs** option.

3. Click on the button that says **Create VPC** on the top side.

4. Fill the form that appears with the data below.

    **Name tag:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab    
    **IPv4 CIDR block:** 10.0.0.0/16   
    **IPv6 CIDR block:** Amazon provided IPv6 CIDR block    
    **Tenancy:** Default

    <span style="color:silver;">Note</span>
    Be aware of the VPC description that appears in the form.
    A VPC is an isolated portion of the AWS cloud populated by AWS objects, such as Amazon EC2 instances. You must specify an IPv4 address range for your VPC. Specify the IPv4 address range as a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16. You cannot specify an IPv4 CIDR block larger than /16. You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with the VPC.

    By default, when you create a custom VPC, the following components are created.
    - A router
    - A main route table
    - A main ACL
    - A main Security Group     
    

5. On the VPC section, verify that the VPC was created successfully and then make click on **Subnets** on the left menu.

6. Click on the button that says **Create subnet** on the top side.

7. Fill the form that appears with the data below.

    **Name tag:** subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab   
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab     
    **Availability Zone:** us-east-1a    
    **IPv4 CIDR block:** 10.0.1.0/24    
    **IPv6 CIDR block:** Don't Assign IPv6  

8. Repeat the steps 5 and 6 in order to create a second subnet.

9. Fill the form that appears with the data below.
    
    **Name tag:** subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab  
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab     
    **Availability Zone:**  us-east-1b    
    **IPv4 CIDR block:** 10.0.2.0/24    
    **IPv6 CIDR block:** Don't Assign   

10. Go to the **Subnet** section and select **subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab**, then click on Actions button on the top side, then click on Modify auto-assign 
IP settings and finally select Auto-assign IPv4 option.

11. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** section and on the left menu click on **Internet Gateways** and then click on **Create internet gateway** on the top side.

12. Fill the form that appears with the data below.     
    
    **Name tag:** igw-vpc-us-east-1-test-lab    

13. Attach the internet gateway to the VPC **vpc-us-east-1-test-lab**

14. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** section and on the left menu click on **Route Tables** and then click on **Create route table** on the top side.

15. Fill the form that appears with the data below.

    **Name tag:** rtb-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab   
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab 

16. Repeat the steps 14 and 15 in order to create a route table for the private subnet.

    **Name tag:** rtb-subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab  
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab

17. Select the route table **rtb-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab** and on the bottom side select routes and then click on the 
Edit routes button.

18. Add the following rules and then click save.    

    | Destination 	| Target                     	|
    |-------------	|----------------------------	|
    | 0.0.0.0/0   	| igw-vpc-us-east-1-test-lab 	|
    | ::/0        	| igw-vpc-us-east-1-test-lab 	|       
    |               |                               |

19. Select the route table **rtb-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab** and on the bottom side select **subnet associations** and then click on Edit subnet associations, 
select **subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab and save.**

20. Create a **NAT gateway** associated with the subnet **subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab** and add a tag name as **ng-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab**

21. Select the route table **rtb-subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab** and on the bottom side select routes and then click on the Edit routes button.

22. Add the following rules and then click save.

    | Destination 	| Target                             	|
    |-------------	|------------------------------------	|
    | 0.0.0.0/0   	| ng-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab 	|
    |

23. Select the route table **rtb-subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab** and on the bottom side select subnet associations and then click on Edit subnet
associations, select **subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab** and save.

24. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** section and on the left menu click on **Network ACLs** and then click on **Create network ACL** on the top side.

25. Create two ACL one for the public subnet and another for the private subnet.
    
    **\[ACL-1\]**   
    **Name tag:** acl-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab   
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab 
    
    **\[ACL-2\]**   
    **Name tag:** acl-subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab  
    **VPC:** vpc-us-east-1-test-lab     

26. Associate each ACL with its corresponding subnet.

27. Add to each ACL the rules you need.

28. Create two Security Groups one for the public subnet and another for the private subnet.
    
    **\[SG-1\]**   
    **Security group name:** sg-acl-subnet-us-east-1a-public-test-lab   
    **Description:** Any description    
    **VPC:**  vpc-us-east-1-test-lab
    
    **\[SG-2\]**   
    **Security group name:** sg-acl-subnet-us-east-1b-private-test-lab   
    **Description:** Any description    
    **VPC:**  vpc-us-east-1-test-lab
