You may have heard that Bitcoin is based on cryptography, which is a branch of mathematics used extensively in computer security. Cryptography means
"secret writing" in Greek, but the science of cryptography encompasses more than just secret writing, which is referred to as encryption.
Cryptography can also be used to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing that secret (digital signature), or prove the authenticity of data
(digital fingerprint). These types of cryptographic proofs are the mathematical tools critical to bitcoin and used extensively in bitcoin applications.

Ironically, encryption is not an important part of bitcoin, as its communications and transaction data are not encrypted and do not need to be encrypted
to protect the funds.   [mastering bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#keys-addresses)

ECDSA (‘Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm’) is the cryptography behind private and public keys used in Bitcoin. It consists of combining the math behind finite fields 
and elliptic curves to create one way equations, meaning you can choose your private key “Pick a number between 1 and $$2^{256}$$.” and easily calculate your public key 
(some other number). However, You can not take the public key and easily calculate their private key. In fact, for Bitcoin it would take trillions of computers trillions of years 
of continuous guessing of different private keys to figure out which one creates a given public key. [How does ECDSA work in Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@blairlmarshall/how-does-ecdsa-work-in-bitcoin-7819d201a3ec)

# Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)

**Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)** is based on the discrete logarithm problem that is based on elliptic curves over finite fields (Galois fields).
The main benefit of ECC over other types of public key algorithms is that it needs a smaller key size while providing the same level of security as, f
or example, RSA.

An elliptic curve will simply be the set of points described by the equation:

$$
\displaystyle y^{2} \ =\ x^{3} \ +\ ax\ +\ b\ where\ 4a^{3} \ +\ 27b^{2} \ \neq \ 0
$$

(this is required to exclude [singular curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics))) The equation above is what is called Weierstrass normal
form for elliptic curves.

If we want to explicitly take into account the point at infinity, we can refine our definition of elliptic curve as follows:

$$
\left\{( x,y) \ \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \ |\ y^{2} =x^{3} +ax+b,\ 4a^{3} +27b^{2} \neq 0\right\} \ \cup \ \{0\}
$$
    
## Algebraic addition

Algebraic formulae are constructed to efficiently compute the geometric arithmetic.

### Adding distinct points P and Q

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bitcoin/elliptic_curve_point_addition.png)

$$
 \begin{array}{l}
When\ P=(_{Xp} ,_{Yp}) \ and\ Q\ =(_{Xq} ,_{Yq\ }) \ are\ not\ negative\ of\ each\ other,\ P\ +\ Q\ =\ R\ \ \\
where\ m\ =\ \ \frac{(_{Yp} -_{Yq\ })}{(_{Xp} -_{Xq\ })} \ \ \\
_{Xr} \ =m^{2} \ −\ _{Xp} \ -\ _{Xq} \ \\
_{Yr} \ =\ -_{Yp} \ +\ m(_{Xp} \ -\ _{Xr})
\end{array}
$$

**Note that m is the slope of the line through P and Q.**

## Doubling the point P

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bitcoin/elliptic_curve_scalar_multiplication.png)

When P and Q share the same position (X and Y wise), addind two points (P and Q ) that share the same location **is called “Doubling the point P” also referred as adding a point to itself.**

$$
 \begin{array}{l}
When\ Yp\ \neq 0,\ 2P\ =\ R\ \\
where\ m\ =\ \frac{\left( 3Xp^{2} \ +\ a\right)}{( 2Yp\ )} \ \\
_{Xr} \ =m^{2} \ −\ _{2Xp}\\
_{Yr} \ =\ -_{Yp} \ +\ m(_{Xp} \ -\ _{Xr})
\end{array}
$$

**Recall that a is one of the parameters chosen with the elliptic curve and that m is the tangent on the point P.**

## Elliptic curve point multiplication

Elliptic curve point multiplication is the operation of successively adding a point along an elliptic curve to itself repeatedly. It is used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) 
as a means of producing a one-way function. The literature presents this operation as scalar multiplication, thus the most common name is elliptic curve scalar multiplication, as 
written in Hessian form of an elliptic curve. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication)

Point addition and point doubling allow us to define scalar multiplication for elliptic curves such that, xP = R where x is a scalar, P is a point tangent to the curve and R is the 
resulting point from adding P on to itself x times. 

The straightforward way of computing a point multiplication is through repeated addition. However, this is a fully exponential approach to computing the multiplication.

There are several algorithms used to calculate the scalar multiplication: 

- [Elliptic curve point multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication)

- [Fast point multiplication algorithms for binary elliptic curveswith and without precomputation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/427.pdf)


# Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm **(ECDSA)**

**Bitcoin** uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm **(ECDSA)** based on elliptic curve cryptography. The particular elliptic
curve is known as [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1), which is the curve **Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)**.

$$
\displaystyle y^{2} \ =\ x^{3}+7
$$

The elliptic curve domain parameters over Fp associated with a Koblitz curve secp256k1 are specified by the sextuple

T = (p,a,b,G,n,h) where the finite field Fp is defined by:

    p = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F
    = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 24 - 1

$$\displaystyle The\ curve\ E:\ y^{2} \ =\ x^{3} +ax+b\ over\ Fp\ is\ defined\ by:$$

    a = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
    b = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000007

The base point G in compressed form is:

    G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798

and in uncompressed form is:

    G = 04 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8

Finally the order n of G and the cofactor are:

    n = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141
    h = 01

**secp256k1** has characteristic p, it is defined over the prime field ℤp. Some other curves in common use have characteristic 2, and are defined over a binary Galois field GF(2n), but secp256k1 is not one of them.

As the a constant is zero, the ax term in the curve equation is always zero, hence the curve equation becomes $$\displaystyle y^{2} \ =\ x^{3}+7$$

## Private and Public Keys

A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key. The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at
random. [mastering bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#keys-addresses)

### Private Keys

A private key is simply a number, picked at random. Ownership and control over the private key is the root of user control over all funds associated with
the corresponding bitcoin address. The private key is used to create signatures that are required to spend bitcoin by proving ownership of funds used in a
transaction. The private key must remain secret at all times, because revealing it to third parties is equivalent to giving them control over the
bitcoin secured by that key. The private key must also be backed up and protected from accidental loss, because if it’s lost it cannot be recovered and
the funds secured by it are forever lost, too. [mastering bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#private-keys)

### Generating a private key from a random number


The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as
"Pick a number between 1 and $$2^{256}$$." The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable.
Bitcoin software uses the underlying operating system’s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy (randomness). Usually, the OS random number
generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds. [mastering bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#generating-a-private-key-from-a-random-number)

More precisely, the private key can be any number between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, where n is a constant (n = 1.1578 * 1077, slightly less than $$2^{256}$$) defined
as the order of the elliptic curve used in bitcoin. [mastering bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch04.asciidoc#generating-a-private-key-from-a-random-number)
