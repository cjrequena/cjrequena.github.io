## Summary
The objective of this reference document is to define the best practices and frameworks for developing APIs.

This is a development guide that contains rules and standards to follow in the building of APIs following the best
practices of design and continuous improvement.

## Overview
The API’s job is to make the developer as successful as possible.

The orientation for APIs is to think about design choices from the application developer’s point of view.

The primary design principle when crafting your API should be to maximize developer productivity and success.

A right design communicates how something will be used. The question becomes - what is the design with optimal benefit
for the app developer?

The developer point of view is the guiding principle for all the specific tips and best practices we’ve compiled.
