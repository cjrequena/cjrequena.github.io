# Creating VPC without using the wizard

In this post we are going to create a VPC with a private and public subnet without using the wizard to get into VPC in detail and to know how it works 
internally. 

You also can create your VPC using the wizard following the AWS tutorial 
[Creating a VPC with Public and Private Subnets for Your Compute Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/create-public-private-vpc.html)
